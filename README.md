# Identifying Predatory Online Degree Programs with IPEDS, by Christian Smith

This repository is for a study of equity implications from the expansion of exclusively online higher education degree programs. We are  preparing a preanalysis plan which will be posted here: https://osf.io/prereg/

The repository thus far includes code that automates the downloading and building of datasets from public IPEDS source data. We also include code that plots the expansion of exclusively online degree programs. All replication code is in STATA but is provided and executed in Jupyter Notebooks (.ipnynb) using a Stata Kernel. For details see: https://kylebarron.dev/stata_kernel/

If you would like to use the STATA code, you can browse .ipynb NoteBook files in this repository and cut and paste code into your own STATA .do files.

If you would like to edit and execute the .ipynb NoteBook files but do not have Jupyter, you can use the following instructions prepared by Derek Devnich for installing Git, Jupyter, and the STATA Kernel for Jupyter:
* Install Git: https://libguides.ucmerced.edu/software-carpentry/git/install
* Install the Anaconda distribution of Python. This will also install Jupyter Lab: https://libguides.ucmerced.edu/software-carpentry/python/install
* Configure Jupyter Lab to use the STATA kernel: https://libguides.ucmerced.edu/software-carpentry/python/stata
